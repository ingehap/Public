Data
	sport data - espn.com

Decision making
	reversible/fast or irreversible/slow?
	escalate immediately true misalignments
	disagree and commit
	good course correction => lower info needed

Dual process
	1. plan/execute/effective/model
	2. explore/test/iterative/data

Heuristics
	analysis/diastole vs. synthesis/systole
	consistency/falsification/counterexamples/outliers
	dialectics = pursue truth by Q&A
	epagoge = make rules from examples
	HDM (science): build, measure, learn loop
	Hermeneutics (humaniora): overall consistency
	possible actions to improve the odds?
	weak links?
	underestimated ignorance/uncertainty?
	new options?
	strategy (where, when) & tactics (how)
        what do the best imformed think?
	actions needs to be weighted with non-actions
	worst case risk of new things is known? downside of old things?
	effect of heterogeneity by calculation of elasticities
	boundary/extreme cases; controlling factors
	hypothetic cases
	reductio ad absurdum
	where are my blind spots/ignorance/biases?
	attitude: love truth, stay humble, test everything, keep what is good
	randomized controlled trial (RCT)
	bayesian decision analysis, game theory, decision trees

Hypotheses
	simple, precise, testable
	extreme cases
	examples/patterns

Ivy Lee Method
	at the end of day plan and prioritize tasks

Models
	assumptions
	mapping to easier (analog?) models
	add complexity to solved cases
	Bayesian stochastic models with updating
	get examples/observations/measurements
	do simulations: best/worst/average case

Operational process
	keep fixed problems fixed
	eliminate fixed problems at root
	inspect processes

Proactive
	improve service
	add benefits/features
	lower price, increase value, refund policy
	fast delivery, large selection
	listen to the customer and work backwards      

Social structures
	power = pattern of systematic dominance in a social structure
	inner circle = common interest; elitism
	stability: what is a person is in a different position?
	understand policy
		long division
		elasticity A vs B (rel change A divided by rel change B)
		find uniform segments
		find complementaries (x & y comp iff dy/dx > 0)
	compare policies, for each policy
		what do you want to achieve?
		what resources are required?
		what is output/unit input (time, cost)?
	group behavior
		identify homogeneous segments
		assign weight factor for each segment

Task breakdown
	purpose of task
	stakeholders
	find 1 - 5 subtasks for feedbacks
